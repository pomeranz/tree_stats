###                         TREE_STATS                                   ###


Description:

This script defines a function that collects some statistics from a tree 
directory. The directory needs to be passed to the function. 

-total tree length
-minimum/maximum branch length
-number of leaf nodes
-number of different species
-number of paralogs 
(that is number of leaf nodes - number of different species)
-number of human sequences


It also stores them in a tabular file which can then be accessed.

Instructions: 

Run the script. It will create a function.
It needs to be passed a directory with the locations of 
the tree files.
Optional arguments are the ouput file name and the directory
in which the results should be put.

## INPUT 

# directory = "/home/gideon/Documents/mphil_internship/Trees/*/*"

# to change directories etc..
import os
# Package to access the files on the server. 
import glob
